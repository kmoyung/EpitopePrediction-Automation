# EpitopePrediction-Automation

_An R script that automatically retrieves epitope binding data from the EpitopePrediction package._

This is useful for users to pull out data in a large quantity generated via the software EpitopePrediction, given a specific protein sequence in question.

_Note:_ To use the script, you must install the EpitopePrediction library. Instructions can be found below in "Instructions for using EpitopePrediction".
